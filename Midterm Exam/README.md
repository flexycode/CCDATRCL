### ðŸ’Ž Project Proposal
Conceptualize a goods supplychain management scenario, and develop a goods warehouse management information system to meet the business operation requirements of goods inbound, inventory management, and outbound.

### ðŸ§  Overview 
The frontend is built using JSP, but only uses `${pageContext.request.contextPath}`. 
The UI is based on Layui, and it uses a small amount of Ajax, making it a separated frontend and backend project.

### ðŸ“‹ Project Requirements

The basic module requirements are as follows:

**1. Login Functionality**
* Connect to the database
* Verify username and password to determine if the user is legitimate
* Upon successful login, redirect to the main page
* Upon failed login, display a dialog box with an error message

**2. Main Page Design**
* After login, redirect to the main page
* The main page displays links to various functional pages
* Clicking on a link navigates to the corresponding functional pages

**3. Main Page Design**
* Implement product basic information addition, update, deletion and search by product name
* **Product search:**
  - Save changes to the database and refresh the page after clicking the modify button
  - Delete the corresponding record from the database and refresh the page after clicking the delete button
 
**4. Inbound Operations**
* Include inbound information addition and update, query and deletion

**5. Outbound Operations**
* Include outbound information addition and update, query and deletion

**6. Product Full-Track Management**
* Track each batch of products, including querying each batch's outbound records and inventory changes

**7. Staff Management**
* Implement staff addition, deletionm modification and query

**8. Algorithm Implementation: Circular Queue in Data Structure**
* Implement a circular queue data structure to efficiently manage and store data
* The circular queue should support basic operations such as enqueue, dequeue and peek
* The implementation should consider memory efficiency and performance optimization
